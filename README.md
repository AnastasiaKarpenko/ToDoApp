# ToDoApp
To do app (task manager). Implementing the 32 "Exploring Android" tutorials provided by CommonsWare

I am building the ToDoApp in order to learn several Android concepts like: 
Android Architecture components, Instrumentation Testing, Data Binding Framework, MVI flow, Repository pattern, and start using RxJava.  

In progress: fixing the issue of Data Binding error (cannot find the Data Binding component) after intergation of Room into the app.
